            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-9"> Big Time is a thrilling multiplayer RPG created specifically for PC. It incorporates an engaging combat system along with a vast in-game economy, enabling players to actively produce and exchange a variety of game items. The developers' approach is to seamlessly integrate Web3 components into the gameplay, without compromising players' enjoyment, and to attract a broader audience.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>Big Time Studios is embarking on a significant funding initiative, securing $21 million to introduce nonfungible tokens (NFTs) into the most prominent game economies. This Los Angeles-based company, led by Ari Meilich, former CEO of Decentraland, and game designer Thor Alexander, has set its sights on transforming the industry. Join us as we delve into the intricacies of this groundbreaking project in our exclusive Big Time Review article, brought to you by Coincu.
            </p>
            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-10"> How does Bigtime Crypto Game work?</h2>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-11">Big Time has introduced a new functionality known as Timelines that allows players to advance their character through various class paths and also switch between classes. At present, there are three classes to choose from: Warrior, Chronomancer, and Shadowblase. This feature provides players with the flexibility to explore different playstyles and enhance their gaming experience. This game takes players on a journey through time and space, allowing them to interact with renowned historical figures.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The main objective of the game is to uncover a mysterious threat that disrupts the fabric of time and causes unexpected changes in history. The entire experience is delivered through an online platform that enables hundreds of players to embark on this adventure together in Big Time.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>In this game, every player has the opportunity to acquire loot. Throughout the course of the game, players have the opportunity to acquire a wide range of fresh gear, mounts, pets, player rankings, and titles. In regards to the in-game economy, there exist "scarce" items that can be bartered, leased, or exchanged with other players beyond the realm of Big Time.
Players have the opportunity to discover these valuable items. To gain a clearer understanding, let's consider an example: if a player successfully defeats the ultimate boss in a dungeon, they can earn a non-fungible token (NFT). It is important to highlight that NFTs will solely consist of cosmetic items, which can be traded for cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currency. Furthermore, the game includes non-tradable items like equipment that enhance our abilities within the game. However, it is not possible to exchange this equipment for cryptocurrencies or fiat money.
            </p>
            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-12"><b>Outstanding Big Time Features</b>
            </h2>
            <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-13">What is the goal of the project?<br>
            </h3>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-14">The gaming industry is predominantly observing from the sidelines, actively engaging in research and development surrounding blockchain technology. There appears to be a significant apprehension among industry players regarding the potential public relations risks associated with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as the importance of implementing them correctly. Everyone is eagerly anticipating the emergence of a high-quality game that can serve as a shining example of how this technology can be effectively utilized. While efforts are being made in that direction, the industry is also focused on gathering concrete data to ascertain whether the monetary advantages of NFTs persist beyond a certain threshold of monthly active users, such as 100,000 or 200,000.</p>
            <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-15"> What do unique selling points refer to?</h3>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-16">Big Time will provide a selection of clothing and armor from various historical eras, allowing you to outfit your hero and showcase your personal awesomeness to the world. However, the options don't end there. Each player will have their very own Time Machine, which can be customized with a wide array of items. You can adorn your space with new furniture, proudly display trophies commemorating your time-traveling adventures, or exhibit your unique collection of NFT artwork for your friends to admire. And what better location to flaunt all of your treasures than Epoch City, the expansive metropolis situated at the furthest reaches of the universe.</p>
            <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-17"><b>Reimagining NFTs in the realm of blockchain gaming</b>
            </h3>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-18">NFTs and trading bots for futures have become highly sought-after commodities in the current market, fueled by the cryptocurrency frenzy. NFTs utilize blockchain technology, a transparent and secure digital ledger, to provide unique identification for digital assets, ensuring their authenticity and rarity. On the other hand, futures trading bots leverage real-time data to execute complex algorithms that can have a significant impact on trading activities.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The primary offering of the company is its flagship game called Big Time, which takes players on an exhilarating adventure through space and time. The game commences at a school located at the edge of time, overseen by the esteemed headmaster Albert Einstein. In this captivating storyline, players are placed in the driver's seat of their very own time machine, empowering them to gather legendary items from extraordinary historical battles.
            </p>
            <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-19"><b>Thoughtfully designed and distinctive characteristic</b>
            </h3>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-20">Time travel is a boundless canvas for the imagination. However, it's surprising that there aren't countless other time travel games available. The reason is that executing time travel in-game is incredibly challenging due to the intricate rules and complexities involved. It's not easy to find a concept that is both easy to understand and emotionally captivating. If we simplify it to its essence, the surprising intersections of time and space, along with the narratives that encompass multiple generations, could potentially create something extraordinary. &nbsp;<br>
              <br>In gaming, the concept of time travel enables players to delve into both the familiar and the uncharted territories. It offers the opportunity to revisit beloved historical characters and introduce new ones. It enables us to craft a narrative that plays with our knowledge of the past, while simultaneously defying our expectations, ultimately reshaping history in unique ways.

            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-23"><b>Big Time boasts an exceptional group of developers</b>
            </h2>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-24"> As the originator of Decentraland, Meilich was a trailblazer in the realm of NFTs. After the company transitioned into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), operated by token-holding owners, Meilich departed and embarked on a new endeavor. In April 2020, he established Big Time Studios.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>Based in Los Angeles, Big Time Studios is the driving force behind the development of this game. The primary objective of the company is to introduce cryptocurrency-enabled video games to a wider and more inclusive audience.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The game team boasts an impressive roster, with members credited for their involvement in beloved gaming franchises such as Fortnite, God of War, Call of Duty, and Overwatch. By operating as a remote-first company, the team has been able to combine their diverse passions, resulting in a game world that embodies an evocative style and universally resonant themes. The team responsible for establishing the company is composed of individuals with extensive experience in the gaming industry. Matt Tonks, known for his work on Fortnite and Gears of War, assumes the role of chief technology officer. Carlo Arellano, recognized for his contributions to World of Warcraft and God of War, takes on the position of art director. Brian Alexander, who has worked on Overwatch 2 and Defiance, serves as the lead writer. TJ Stamm, with his background in Call of Duty and Medal of Honor, is the lead level designer. Finally, Tom Zhao, known for his involvement in League of Legends and Sky: Children of the Light, leads the concept art team. Together, these individuals bring their expertise and talent to the table, ensuring a strong foundation for the company's success.
            </p>
            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-25">The imaginative creation of artwork for games</h2>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-26">Big Time's art style possesses an air of enigma, as it relies heavily on the environments themselves to convey the narrative. The entire artistic aspect of the game is meticulously crafted to tell a story and provide players with hints to unravel its deeper mysteries.
Big Time's art style is both minimalist and impactful when it comes to design. Even though the game boasts a vast open world that encompasses different historical eras, the developers have skillfully crafted it to be manageable for a small team of highly skilled professionals. These developers are experts in their field and have successfully breathed life into the game through their expertise.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The art team is currently engrossed in exploring the infinite possibilities of time travel. They have swiftly accumulated a treasure trove of sketches, concepts, and 3D models. Make sure to follow their social media platforms, where they will be showcasing many of these exquisite pieces.<br>
              <br>The art style of Big Time is everlasting, standing the test of time. It was crucial for the game to maintain its visual appeal even a decade after its initial release. While MMOs and online games can endure for a significant period, most eventually succumb to the signs of aging in their art style. To avoid this fate, Big Time opted for a non-photorealistic, retro-inspired look from the start.<br>
              <br>In your journey through the realm of Big Time, you will receive assistance from a range of meticulously designed extraterrestrial weapons. Let's take a glimpse at a few examples from our initial arsenal:&nbsp;<br>- A Combination of Sword and Shield&nbsp;<br>- The Two-Handed Greatsword&nbsp;<br>- The Powerful Warhammer<br>- The Quantum Staff&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;Dual Blades&nbsp;<br>- The Mighty Battle Axe.

            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-27">Big Time Market</h2>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-28">Big Time Studios has brought together a group of individuals who previously worked at well-known gaming companies like Epic Games, Riot Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and Decentraland. The team at Big Time Studios comprises former employees from these renowned gaming companies. Their ultimate goal is to persuade triple-A game companies to embrace the use of cryptocurrency and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) technology. However, before they can achieve this, they are focused on developing their own action role-playing game. This game will allow players to easily obtain, possess, and exchange virtual items that are based on NFTs. The aim is to eliminate the obstacles commonly associated with blockchain applications.</p>
            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-29">What about investing in Big Time?</h2>

            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-30">Before the release of Big Time, the company had already expressed its intention to sell NFT tokens through a widely used exchange platform. In May of this year, Big Time Studios organized a fundraising campaign aimed at bringing NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) to one of the largest economies in the world. The campaign successfully raised a total of $21 million, which was divided into two segments. One part of the funding came from reputable organizations like North Island Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and FBG Capital. The purpose of this initiative was to introduce NFT to a wider audience and capitalize on the growing popularity of blockchain-based digital assets. By securing financial support from prominent entities in the industry, Big Time Studios is poised to make significant strides in revolutionizing the way digital content is bought, sold, and owned. The other portion received funding from Sound Ventures, which is backed by Ashton Kutcher.</p>
            <h2 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default u-text-31"> Reaching the end of the Big Time Review, we can draw some important conclusions</h2>
            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-32">Meilich mentioned that, for now, the company does not plan to transform itself into a user-run DAO, as it would result in additional governance responsibilities. However, in the future, if there is sufficient demand, the company intends to establish methods for players to withdraw their assets and transfer them to any blockchain.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>Big Time presents a significant opportunity for AAA game companies to incorporate blockchain technology into their games. The concept of utilizing NFTs in Big Time sets it apart from other games, making it truly unique. The success of Big Time could potentially set a new trend and offer innovative ideas for integrating blockchain into the gaming industry. With its captivating time travel narrative, experienced development team, forward-thinking leadership, and prominent supporters, Big Time has the potential to become the first AAA blockchain game. We hope that this review of Big Time has provided you with a better understanding of this project.
